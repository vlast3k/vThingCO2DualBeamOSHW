# Short Summary

Monitoring CO2 is a trending topic, yet there are few things the current devices lack, so i opted to change this:

* Calibration - Most existing CO2 Monitors need to see fresh air each few days to do some internal calibration. With a Dual Beam NDIR sensor this is no longer necessary. The sensor can be operated also in places that seldom see fresh air, so that the real CO2 value is always correct.
* Connectivity - The device can be easily integrated with any existing Home Automation System over HTTP or MQTT. Also native connectivity to some online services like Thingspeak, Ubidots, IFTTT is available
* Price - By optimizing the device for price, you will get a sleek 3D Printed enclosure, no paper box to throw away and no lost money due to marketing campaigns.
